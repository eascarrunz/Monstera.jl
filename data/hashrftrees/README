# Samples of Phylogenetic Trees

Taken from HashRF (Sul & Williams 2008 [^1]) under GPL-2.0. See 
[here](https://github.com/sofish/HashRF) for an archive of the original source code and 
data.

- 20,000 trees obtained from a Bayesian analysis of an alignment
of 150 taxa (23 desert taxa and 127 others from freshwater,
marine, ands oil habitats) with 1,651 aligned sites [^2]. The
majority and strict consensus resolution rates for these 20,000
trees are 87% and 34%, respectively.

- 33,306 trees obtained from an analysis of a three-gene, 567 taxa
(560 angiosperms, seven outgroups) dataset with 4,621 aligned
characters, which is one of the largest Bayesian analyses done
to date [^3]. The majority and strict consensus resolution rates
for these 33,306 trees are 93% and 51%, respectively.

The sample trees are randomly selected from the above data tree sets.
- 150-taxa-10-trees.tre: 150 taxa, 10 trees.
- 150-taxa-1000-trees.tre: 150 taxa, 1000 trees.
- 567-taxa-10-trees.tre: 567 taxa, 10 trees.
- 567-taxa-1000-trees.tre: 567 taxa, 1000 trees.
