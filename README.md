This is an experimental package for phylogenetics in Julia.

These are the main objectives of this package:

- Provide a general interface for basic operations with phylogenetic trees, allowing the 
experimentation with a variety of data structures to represent trees

- Allow as much flexibility as possible:
    - Taxa can live in inner or outer nodes
    - Non-splitting nodes are permitted

- Be ergonomic for interactive use
